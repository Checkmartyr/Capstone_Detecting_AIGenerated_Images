# Capstone Project: Detecting AI-Generated Images

## Overview
The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) today have created increasingly realistic images, presenting a challenge in distinguishing between human-generated and AI-generated images. This project explores the application of deep learning, neural networks, and machine learning to differentiate between human-generated and AI-generated images accurately and effectively.

## Abstract
Our research presents a comprehensive analysis of various deep learning architectures, including traditional machine learning methods. By training models on diverse datasets of human-generated and AI-generated images, we assess performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Notably, feature extraction using the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), combined with traditional machine learning methods, achieves high accuracy in differentiating between the two types of images, with performance comparable to or exceeding that of deep learning. Additionally, we discuss the implications of our findings for digital content and AI ethics, underscoring the potential of AI tools in maintaining the integrity of visual media in an era where AI plays an increasingly significant role.

## Introduction
This project aims to address the challenge of distinguishing between human-generated and AI-generated images by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. The increasing realism of AI-generated images necessitates robust methods to ensure the integrity of visual media.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
We collected a diverse dataset comprising both human-generated and AI-generated images to train and evaluate our models.

### Feature Extraction
Feature extraction was performed using the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), which captures texture information from images.

### Model Training
We employed various deep learning architectures and traditional machine learning methods to train models on the extracted features. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate the models.

## Results
Our experimental results demonstrate that traditional machine learning methods, combined with GLCM feature extraction, can achieve high accuracy in differentiating between human-generated and AI-generated images. The performance of these methods is comparable to, or exceeds, that of deep learning approaches.

## Discussion
The findings highlight the effectiveness of GLCM-based feature extraction and traditional machine learning methods in image classification tasks. We also discuss the ethical implications of AI-generated content and the importance of maintaining the integrity of digital media.

## Conclusion
This research underscores the potential of AI tools in distinguishing between human-generated and AI-generated images, contributing to the preservation of visual media integrity in an era of rapid AI advancements.

## Future Work
Future research could explore the integration of additional feature extraction techniques and the development of more sophisticated models to further improve classification accuracy.
